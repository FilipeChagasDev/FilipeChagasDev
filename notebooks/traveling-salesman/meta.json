    "title": "Solving the Traveling Salesman Problem with Simulated Annealing",
    "abstract": "This notebook addresses the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), which seeks the shortest possible route for a salesman to visit a set of cities and return to the starting point. It uses the Simulated Annealing algorithm, a probabilistic technique inspired by the annealing process in metallurgy, to explore potential solutions and efficiently find a near-optimal route.",
